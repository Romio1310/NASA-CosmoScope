The surface is covered in iron oxide (rust), giving it that iconic red color. Temperatures range from -195°F to 70°F. Scientists have found evidence of ancient water flows and are actively searching for signs of past life! What else about Mars interests you? 🚀";

Earth has one moon and takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun. The atmosphere is perfect for life - 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen! What would you like to know about our home planet? ✨";

It provides all the energy for life on Earth through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. Fun fact: The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has enough fuel to shine for another 5 billion years! 🌟";

The edge is called the event horizon - cross it and you're gone forever! But here's the weird part: time slows down near them due to Einstein's relativity.
