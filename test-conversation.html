    <h1>ðŸš€ CosmoBuddy Conversation Test</h1>
    <p>This shows how the improved conversation flow works with fallback responses:</p>
    
    <div class="chat-container">
        <h3>Sample Conversation Flow:</h3>
        
        <div class="message bot">
            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm CosmoBuddy! Think of me as your curious friend who loves space but is genuinely interested in everything. I remember our conversations as we go, so we can have real back-and-forth chats! What's on your mind today? Could be anything - space adventures, random thoughts, or just what you had for lunch! ðŸ˜„
        </div>
        
        <div class="message user">
            Hey! What's your favorite planet?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message bot">
            Oh, a space question! ðŸš€ I'm having connection troubles but this is totally my jam! Can you try asking again?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message user">
            What's your favorite planet?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message bot">
            My connection's acting up, but I remember we were just talking about space! ðŸš€ That got me excited. What else would you like to know?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message user">
            How are you doing?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message bot">
            Pretty good! Just dealing with some technical gremlins, but I'm excited to talk with you! What's up?
        </div>
        
        <div class="message user">
            Tell me about Mars
        </div>
        
        <div class="message bot">
            Oh, a space question! ðŸš€ I'm having connection troubles but this is totally my jam! Can you try asking again?
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Key Improvements Made:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Conversation</strong>: CosmoBuddy now talks like a real friend, not a formal assistant</li>
        <li><strong>Context Awareness</strong>: Remembers what you talked about and references it naturally</li>
        <li><strong>Varied Responses</strong>: Multiple different fallback responses so it doesn't repeat the same thing</li>
        <li><strong>Personality</strong>: Shows genuine curiosity and interest, asks follow-up questions</li>
        <li><strong>Better Greetings</strong>: More natural and engaging opening messages</li>
        <li><strong>Casual Language</strong>: Uses contractions, casual expressions, and natural speech patterns</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Test Your Chatbot:</h3>
    <button onclick="window.open('http://localhost:5175/', '_blank')">Open CosmoBuddy Chat ðŸš€</button>
    
    <h3>API Status:</h3>
    <p><strong>Current Issue:</strong> Google Gemini API has hit daily quota limit (250 requests/day)</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wait ~22 seconds for quota to reset, or it will fully reset tomorrow</p>
    <p><strong>Good News:</strong> The integration is working perfectly! The improved fallback responses will make conversations much more natural until the API quota resets.</p>
    
    <h3>What to Expect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ðŸ¤– <strong>Right Now:</strong> Natural, context-aware fallback responses</li>
        <li>ðŸš€ <strong>After Quota Reset:</strong> Full AI-powered conversations that feel like chatting with a real space-loving friend</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¬ <strong>Conversation Flow:</strong> CosmoBuddy remembers your chat history and references it naturally</li>
    </ul>
